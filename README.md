# gold-refining-output-modeling

This repository contains an analysis and model created as part of a coursework project, simulating how machine learning could be applied to a business case.

The objective of the project was to prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for a customer. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry.

The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore using the data on extraction and purification.

The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.

The data is stored in three files, 'gold_recovery_full.csv', 'gold_recovery_test.csv', and 'gold_recovery_train.csv'. The analysis and model are contained within the 'ip2.ipynb' file, which you can view or download here.
